# 61 - A Symmetry-aware Exploration of Bayesian Posterior - Supp

This folder contains:

- two files containing the data and the models used to generate the toy example of Figure 1
- three notebooks to: 1. visualize the data, 2. train custom models, 3. create your
    own version of the Figure with your models
- samples to develop the logic of the scaling and permutation functions for very simple networks

Thank you!
